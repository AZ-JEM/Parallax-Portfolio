**What is the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript (programming language)?**

  JavaScript can add, change or remove elements of the DOM as well as define
  and respond to events within the DOM.

**Describe basic data types, including integers, Booleans, and strings.**

  There are really three primitives "Number", "Boolean" and "String" if you
  exclude "None", "Null" and "Object" (and the ES6 "Symbol" which sounds
  very useful for unique keys in dictionary structures).
  Unlike strongly typed languages like "C", in JS any integer value or float
  of any size and precision is just a "Number". Strings can contain any count
  of characters without prescribed dimension. Booleans are still booleans: they
  are either "true" or "false".

**Describe what happens when you pass an argument to a function.**

  The argument becomes immediately available as a parameter within
  the scope of the function.

**How do you create an event listener using the on() method?**

    There is no "on()" method in javascript to my knowledge.
    However, intercepting a click event using the jQuery "on" method:
    `$('element').on('click', function() {}`

    ...altenatively :
    `$('element').click(function() {});`

    ...and in vanilla javascript:
    `element.addEventListener('click', function() {}`



**User input appears in DOM on submit**

I implemented this as a prompt for name on start up which then
inserts the returned string into my landing page. The code starts
at line #63 of main.js and is commented as "Exercise 2.6"

`var name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
 if (name)
   $('#welcome').text("Welcome " + name + "...");`
